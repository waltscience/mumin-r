title: A quick guide to using multi-model inference for model selecetion in R

<br>
**Use computing power to choose the best fit model.**

Model selection is a longstanding issue in statistical analysis. How should we choose the best model? Kenneth Burnham and David Anderson [argue we should be using insight from information theory to select models](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387953649). Their approach is called Multi-Model Inference.

## How does multi-model inference work?

Very simply, multi-model inference works by testing all possible combinations of variables in a model and ranking them by their fit. Ranking is done using the [Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion). AIC is a measure of model fit, taking into account model simplicity. The aim of multi-model inference and AIC is to determine the best fit model using the fewest variables.

## Using multi-model inference in R

The package MuMIn has everything needed to perform multi-model inference. To test it out, we can use data from the University of Wisconsin County Health Project.

```{r}
packages <- c("readr", "MuMIn", "lme4")                 # packages you will need
lapply(packages, require, character.only = TRUE)        # install and / or load packages
dat <- as.data.frame(read_csv(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waltscience/countyhealth/master/healthdata.csv")))
```

We will build models testing whether diabetes prevalence in a county is related to the following factors:
 
 * Smoking
 * Food environment index
 * Physical inactivity
 * Access to exercise opportunities
 * Excessive drinking prevalence
 * Driving alone to work
 * Population
 
We begin by building a model with all the fixed effect and use county and state as random effects. We can think of this model as the "global" model.

```{r}

```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
